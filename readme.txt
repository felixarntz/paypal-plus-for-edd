Accept payments through PayPal Plus for your store powered by Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

This Easy Digital Downloads extension adds PayPal Plus as a supported payment gateway.

PayPal Plus is an extended service package offered by PayPal to vendors in Germany. In addition to a regular PayPal account, it handles payments with either a credit card, debit (SEPA) or by invoice. PayPal takes care of invoices and reminders.

Note that this extension can only be used by a shop that fulfills PayPal's conditions for PayPal Plus which includes using Euro as currency.

= Requirements =

This plugin is an extension to Easy Digital Downloads. You need to have the plugin installed and activated in order to run it. Furthermore, this plugin requires you to run at least PHP 5.3 on your server and have the `curl` and `openssl` PHP extensions enabled. This is due to the external PayPal libraries it is using.
